# MELISR

MELISR is the collections database of the National Herbarium of Victoria (MEL)
at the Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria.

At MEL we use the [Specify](http://www.sustain.specifysoftware.org/) collections
management software. This repository contains the code of the website we built
around our collections management system to allow our staff to more efficiently
do certain things that are not so easily done in Specify (or weren't when we
implemented in 2010), including printing of labels, loan and exchange paperwork,
loan returns, quality control, uploading of DNA and attachment metadata etc.
